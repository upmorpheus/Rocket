## Short Description
- **Loan Flippa** is a service that interacts with **Aave  v3 Lending pools** to supply and borrow assets using its **flashloan contracts**.

## Long Description

- Defi users should rely on simple tools to trade their assets. Sometimes trading assests can cause major shifts in prices. Defi users who **borrow assets** are sometimes forced to **liquiditate automatically** to pay off their debt. This can lead to **max losses**. Flippa Flashloans provides an easy way to  liquidate positions from outstanding **debts on aave**. We also want common Defi users without any technical backgrounds to use flashloans when they need to. We want to offer **stability** with **volatile assest swapping**, and debt payoff with a **better rates** without incurring maximum losses.

- Earning Flash loan fee
    - The flash loan fee is **initialized at deployment** to `0.09%` and can be updated via Governance Vote. Use `FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TOTA`L to get current value.
    - Flashloan fee can be shared by the LPs (liquidity providers) and the **protocol treasury**. The `FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TOTAL` represents the total fee paid by the borrowers of which:
        - Fee to LP: `FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TOTAL - FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TO_PROTOCOL`
        - Fee to Protocol: `FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TO_PROTOCOL`

- Setting Up
    - Ensure we have enough funds when liquidating
    - Calculate the profitability of liquidating loans vs gas costs
    - Ensure we have access toe the latest protocol user data
    - Fail safe security 
- Aave contracts and registry on Optimism
