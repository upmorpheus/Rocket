### **Decentralized Finance (Defi)** 
Rush â¤½ ðŸŽ  â¤¼ `0` debt

## â–¨GitHub Repository
[**Rush Flashloans**](https://github.com/mmsaki/rush)

## â–¨Short Description
**Rush** makes it easy for Defi users to borrow from Aave's **lending pool** but remain with `0` debt allowing you to possibly stay forever **debt free**. Later we will add our flashloan strategis to **Yearn Vaults** as a strategy to boost yields. 

## â–¨Long Description

**Rush** provides you with python scripts that interacts with **Aave v3 Core lending pool** to borrow assets using **flashloan contracts**. Defi users can rely on simple tools to borrow crypto assets. Sometimes borrowing assets can be a financial burden to you. When you **borrow assets** traditionally you are at risk of a forced **liquiditation** to pay off outstanding debt when the maket movements are against you. This will lead to **max losses** on your porfolio. Rush Flashloans provides an efficient way to benefit from your current borrowing positions. If you supplied **collateral** on Aave, then flahloans might benefit you. We want all the Defi users without any technical backgrounds to learn how to use flashloans without complications. We want to ensure Rush provides **secure contracts** to flashloan with Aave lending pools. Flashloans allow users to **stay debt free**. You only have to pay a **flashloan premium fee** currently at `0.09%`.

You will not make any profits from using flashloans as they are on this repo.

## â–¨How It's Made

- We used Aave V3 Core contracts to build Rush. 
    
    â†³ We deployed to **Optimism Goerli** for testing 

    â†³ We deployed two contracts
        
    - `RushFlashLoan`
        - For borrowing multiple tokens
    - `RushSimpleFlashLoan`
        - For borrowing a single token
    
    â†³ We ensure we have enough funds to pay flashloan fee.

    â†³ We call `.flashloan( )` on the lending pool contract
        
    - Our `RushFlashloan` contract will receive the funds and repay to aave with a flashloan fee.
        - We can add multiple tokens by providing the array of tokens and amounts we want to borrow.
        - With enough net-worth you can borrow upto millions!

## â–¨Aave Flash â¤½ â¤¼ loan fee

The flash loan fee is **initialized at deployment** to `0.09%` which is updated via aave Governance Vote. Use `FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TOTAL` to get current value.

Flashloan fee can be shared by the LPs (liquidity providers) and the **protocol treasury**. 

The `premium_total` represents the total fee paid by the borrowers of which:

Fee to LP = `premium_total` - `flashloan_premium_to_protocol`

Fee to Protocol = `flashloan_premium_to_protocol`

# Yearn Vaults

We deployed some yearn vaults that would used flashloan strategies to boost returns.

Still working on other features but this is what I have so far!

<!-- - Setting Up
    - Ensure we have enough funds when flashloaning
    - Calculate the profitability of liquidating loans vs gas costs
    - Ensure we have access toe the latest protocol user data
