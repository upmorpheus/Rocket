## Short Description
- Loan Flippa is a service that interacts with **Aave  v3 Lending pools** to supply and borrow assets using its flashloan contracts.

## Long Description

- Defi users should rely on simple tools to trade their assets. Sometimes trading assests can cause major shifts in prices. Defi users who borrow assets are sometimes forced to liquiditate automatically to pay off their debt. Flippa Flashloans provides an easy way to  liquidate positions from outstanding debts on aave. We also want common Defi users without any technical backgrounds to use flashloans when they need to. We want to offer stability with volatile assest swapping, and debt payoff with a better rates without incurring maximum losses.
